# Simple Facebook Pixel implementation

Simple Facebook Pixel implementation supporting eCommerce events and Advanced Matching (also SPA).

It is based on the official, now archived [Facebook pixel template](https://github.com/facebookarchive/GoogleTagManager-WebTemplate-For-FacebookPixel/blob/main/template.tpl).

We kept the main loading logic, but removed a lot of legacy code and focused on GA4 events standard.

Features:

- simple code mapping GA4 standard eCommerce events
- support for Advanced Matching for traditional and Single Page Application
